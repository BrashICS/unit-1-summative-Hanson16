      <p style="color: black;"">In 1991, while studying computer science, Linus Torvalds created Linux, an operating system. What makes Linux stand out is that itâ€™s open-source, meaning the code is freely available for anyone to modify, improve, and share. This was revolutionary because it allowed a community of developers to contribute and shape the system, leading to its widespread use today.

      <p style="color: black;"">In 2005 Torvalds created Git a version control system. Torvalds contributions extend far beyond Linux and Git. Linux powers a massive portion of the internet, from servers to cloud computing infrastructures. It is used in supercomputers and is the foundation of Android devices. Git, meanwhile, has become a critical tool for developers worldwide, enabling efficient collaboration and large-scale software development projects.
