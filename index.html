<p style="color: black;"">Linus Torvalds was born on December 28, 1969, in Helsinki, Finland. He developed an interest in programming at a young age, starting with a Commodore VIC-20 when he was just 10 years old. Torvalds later attended the University of Helsinki, where he studied computer science. It was during his time at university that he began working on the Linux kernel, inspired by his desire to improve upon an existing operating system called Minix. In 1991, he released the first version of Linux, which would go on to revolutionize the tech world.</p>
